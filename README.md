# WS Coordination Protocols - Rails
This repository contains the web services protocols WS-Coordination and WS-Transaction implemented in my course competition assignment, which theme is *"web services and atomic transactions in distributed systems"*.

## Systems
Four systems were implemented to simulate WS-Coordination and WS-Transaction protocols:
* **Bank:** every holder can have an account and many cards related to it. It has a web service used by the store to buy products through a card.
